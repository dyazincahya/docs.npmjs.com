# npm Enterprise

npm Enterprise is an on-premises solution for securely sharing and distributing
JavaScript modules within your organization, from the team that maintains npm
and the public npm registry. It's designed for teams that need:

- easy internal sharing of private modules
- better control of development and deployment workflow
- stricter security around deploying open-source modules
- compliance with legal requirements to host code on-premises

## npmE is private npm

npmE is an npm registry that works with the same standard npm client you
already use, but provides the features needed by larger organizations who are
now enthusiastically adopting node. It's built by npm, Inc., the sponsor of
the npm open source project and the host of the public npm registry.
