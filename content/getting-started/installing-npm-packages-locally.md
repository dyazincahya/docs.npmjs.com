# Installing npm packages locally

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JDSfqFFbNYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

If you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node's require, then you want to install locally. On the other hand, if you want to use it as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI, then you can want to install it globally.

## Installing

A package can be downloaded with the command `npm install <package name>`. For example:

```
npm install lodash
```

This will create the `node_modules` directory (if one doesn't exist yet), and will download the package to that directory.

Test: Run `ls node_modules`. You should see a lodash directory inside.

## Using the installed package

Once the package is in node_modules, you can use it in your code. For example, if you are creating a Node module, you can require it.

Create a file named index.js, with the following code:

```
var lodash = require('lodash');

var output = lodash.without([1, 2, 3], 1);
console.log(output);
```

Test: Run the code using `node index.js`. It should output `[2, 3]`.

## Using the --save flag with package.json

Another way to manage npm packages locally is to create a package.json file. If you have a package.json file in your directory and you run `npm install`, then npm will look at the dependencies that are listed in that file and download all of those. This is nice because it makes your build reproducible, which means that you can share it with other developers.

Create a file called `package.json` in your app directory.

```
{
    "name": "demo-app",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Download the package with the --save flag.

```
npm install lodash --save
```

This will download the package as before, but will also add it to the dependencies in `package.json`.

Test: Check the `dependencies` key in package.json. `lodash` should be listed as a dependency.

## Manually adding dependencies to package.json

You can also add dependencies to package.json manually.

Add another package to your dependencies, e.g.:

```
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^2.4.1",
    "tap": "*"
}
```

Test: Run `npm install`, then `ls node_modules`. You should see a `tap` directory.
